## Meal Matchup Firebase Functions

**Do not** edit the files in the `lib` folder. These functions are written in TypeScript within the `src` folder (specifically `src/index.ts`).

Write the functions in `src/index.ts` and then run `npm run build`. This will build them into the `lib` folder using the `tsc` function.

For local testing, you can run `npm run serve`.

See the [functions page on our Wiki](https://github.com/meal-matchup/meal-matchup/wiki/Working-on-Firebase-Functions) for more information.
